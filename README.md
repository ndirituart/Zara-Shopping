# Zara-Shopping
A shopping app to practice authentication and data querying. The GUI will have add to cart, login, register and sign up. Might be improved to clear cart (pay) and OTPÂ authentication.

#GUI
I am using Vue.js for my frontend implementing (HTML, CSS and JS) I have 4 pages so far Signup, Login, Explorepage and User add to cart. One has to login to clear cut, you can "bookmark" things by adding to card but to actually buy you need to login or signup.

#Database
I am using localhost PHPAdmin as my database with Laravel as my interface to query to the database so far
